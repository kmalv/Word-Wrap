# Word Wrap
## Systems Programming - Professor Menendez - Spring 2022
### By Kayla Alvarado - NetID: kma224 - Group 69

To run, type:

```bash
./ww 10 name
```
or

```bash
./ww 10
```

where 10 can be replaced with any positive integer, and name can be replaced by the name of any file or directory.

This implementation was not finished but it should correctly reformat any file given and print to standard output. It also handles getting input from standard input. It does not yet implement wrapping an entire directory.
